In BlankDAO however, proof of uniqueness results in high scalability by maintaining governance of all users while hosting the ledger on a reasonable number of hosts. Simply put, blockchain DApps are hosted by all but governed by some. In contrast, BlankDApps are actually hosted by some but governed by all.",

A process that ends in low scalability for developers and high costs for end users as well. BlankDAO ensures security with minimum costs by using POU to prevent sybil attacks. Therefore, for the first time, the created value can be used for creating added value.",

DEX on Ethereum for instance can only support ETH and ERC-20 tokens. There is no way for them to support Bitcoin, ZCash, etc. without relying on a third party. This is the first time we can implement a decentralized exchange based on 1 vote per person. An exchange that is as scalable as their central counterparts. They are fully open source. People funds are saved in multi-signature cold wallets, keys of which are in control of a reasonable number of delegates selected by people.',
